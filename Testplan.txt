Password Parameters Script

The passwords that are chosen in the electronic accounts must have certain parameters for example (Number of characters, Type of characters, Size of characters).


Create a script that allows us to verify that the parameters of the passwords are met and that it can be modified in the case of each parameter.

I will be using the latest version of Google Chrome.

This test is considered approved:
1.- If the script can verify that the parameters of the passwords are met.
2.- That the parameters can be modified without the script losing functionality.

Deadline:
Test plan: May 9 2018
Script: May 23 2018
